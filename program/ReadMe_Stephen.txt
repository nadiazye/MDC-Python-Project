Project Description: The point of this project is to be a Number Guesser game written in Python.

What the game does: The player selects a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard) and tries to guess a randomly
generated number within a specified range. The number of guesses allowed is determined by the chosen difficulty level.
The program provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high or too low.

How to Use:
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the program files.
3. Run the program by executing the following command in the terminal:
   python program/number_guesser.py

Files:
1. number_guesser.py (located in the 'program' directory)
1. random (standard library)
2. math (standard library)
